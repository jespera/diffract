# Comments

We should have the option of having comments in rules.

# Reuse

Should one be able to re-use a rule?

It should be possible to also scan for multiple rules on multiple files.
- If there are enough rules/files maybe there should be some reuse of matches?

# Use another matching approach

Currently, a simple traversal (with a type-index).
- Maybe datalog could make sense for ease of sharing
- Maybe RETE for sharing of matching results

# Grammar for rules

There needs to be a rule-grammar.
- can there by multiple "on $x" directives (is that what we call them?)

# Review all the code

Claude wrote it, I need to get it and/or rewrite.
